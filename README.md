# First Time Using Pandas 
## This is my homework for Jonathan Soma's Foundations of Computing class 2024.
### We are learning how to use pandas and honestly at this point in my learning-to-be-a-data-journalist journey, I don't even know what anything even means. Like how is this magic even happening? What are all these libraries and modules and what not and how does a single line of code do all this magic. 
### Anyway, for this assignment we looked into two files. One a .csv file called animals and another a .excel file called billionares.
